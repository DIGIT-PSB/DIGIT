This is a General Education Integrative Studies, digital arts course introducing 2D graphics software through the creation of original digital artwork and the exploration of the 2d digital art medium. Course content explores technology, digital art, and visual culture, and concepts of identity, digital culture, and propaganda. Students create original artwork using graphic software such as Adobe Photoshop. They acquire skills and methods of research and development, creative production, critical review, reflection, and strategies for revision. Learning focuses on problem solving, exploration of creative options, visual communication, critique of images and ideas, and reflective writing. Students apply this process of visual research as a personal means of exploring topical issues and ideas, responding in informed ways to the images created by others, and reacting critically and creatively to the visual world around them. The course looks at topics such as the impact of technology on personal identity and community practices as they are represented in the mix of visual culture. Methods of visual expression and graphic communication such as advertising, messaging and propaganda are examined and critically analyzed as cultural practices that serve many purposes, from education, entertainment, marketing, and politics. The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the creative use of digital technologies in responding critically and imaginatively to this changing visual world of image, text and story in which they live. By developing original digital artwork, students learn to formulate and communicate their ideas related to the course topics from a personal perspective and build an understanding of how they make an impact on a world beyond the classroom.

They will enhance their creative and philosophical sensibilities in the technology, software, and media relevant to the field (s) of study they are pursuing.Through a series of learning problems, students will synthesize advanced skills and knowledge needed to accomplish techniques used in the creation of digital 3d imagery. They will integrate 3d sculpting, modeling, animation, and/or painting practices with computer-based image processing for creative, and professionally oriented results. They will develop critical and conceptual sensibilities needed to discuss and evaluate their work and the work of others using these methods. Students will identify, research, and analyze effective professional and creative practices in the field of digital creativity with emphasis on developing skillful digital processing techniques. These practices include creating mockups of concepts, art-making practices for enhanced digital workflow, and choosing the 3d processing techniques most appropriate for the end-use of the work. The digital medium has a relatively short history, however, as the advancement of digital technology continues these techniques have entered the popular mainstream. This shift has raised challenges in graphic-reliant fields such as the arts, engineering, advertising, simulation, and gaming. This course will give students of these fields the opportunity to develop their artistic skills further than possible in Art 168.

                    <td>Waves, physics of sound, hearing, musical scales, musical instruments, and room acoustics. INART 050 The Science of Music (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course explores the physical and acoustical bases of sound and music.The physics include a study of vibrating systems and simple harmonic motion, wave propagation, reflection and refraction, superposition, resonant frequencies, harmonics, phase, the relationship of speed and velocity, and spectra. The acoustics portion applies these physical properties to hearing, sound and music, covering the nature of the human auditory system, and correlations of pitch to frequency, loudness to amplitude/power/intensity, timbre to spectra and envelope. An overview of perceptual psychological studies of Gestalt organizational principles and auditory streaming explores how the auditory system organizes sound on a primitive, unlearned level. NOTE: there need be no specific math prerequisite for the course. Though high school algebra and trigonometry will be recommended, these topics will be integrated with the rest of the course material.With physical and physiological groundwork laid, the subject matter movea to purely musical areas: the construction of musical scales, the nature of consonance, dissonance, and harmony. Twelve-tone equal temperament, the basis of Western common practice music, is not an absolute, but a decision made to facilitate certain musical choices, and a compromise in terms of optimal consonance. The nature of the different instruments is then discussed - strings, winds, brass, percussion, and voice. Different instruments naturally produce different scale types and different types of spectra. Students will learn to appreciate the inherent differences in different instrument types.The course then returns to acoustics, exploring the role that performance spaces play in the propagation and reception of sound. The shape and materials of a room determine its characteristic sound. Students learn about how sound in large auditoriums is characterized by the balance of direct and reflected sound, the distinction between specular and diffuse reflections, the absorptive properties of different building materials, and the nature of reverberation. Smaller performance spaces are subject to standing waves, flutter echo, and comb filtering. Taking steps to avoid undesirable characteristics is often an easy matter once the nature of these characteristics is understood. The final weeks cover audio technology and the distinctions between analog and digital formats. </td>

MUSIC 8 Rudiments of Music (3) (GA)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Learning the rudiments of music can be compared to the learning of a language. Students must learn to hear melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic patterns (audiation) before they sing, play or write in notation. In this introductory class, students are introduced to melodic, harmonic and rhythmic patterns by imitating the instructor who establishes these patterns at the piano, or by singing or as in the case of rhythm by striking a drum head. Eventually students will take turns "tossing" these patterns to teach other. Basic skills of improvisation can also be taught at this level of audiation by having students expand upon the basic patterns. As a result of these creative and aesthetic experiences, students will be able to translate the audiation of patterns into musical notation - moving from the smallest unit of a rhythmic motive towards the creation of a coherent rhythmic phrase. Similarly, at the melodic level, the student will begin with intervallic patterns and move towards the creation of a coherent melodic phrase. Intervals are then combined vertically to form harmonies. At the next stage of learning, students will learn to identify and to write that which they are hearing in dictation.This course in "musical literacy" enables students: (1) to deepen their appreciation of music (2) to begin studying a musical instrument and (3) to enter the rigorous study of music theory required of music majors. </td>
