In ENGL 50 you will explore the genres of nonfiction, fiction, and poetry by reading published essays, short stories, and poems and by writing personal essays, sketches, scenes, and poems.<br /> We'll discuss the relationship between the genres and also discuss what makes each a distinct art form. You'll hand in regular writing assignments in addition to completing longer writing projects.

ENGL 420 Writing for the Web (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course, designed for writers and potential writers, will explore the unique opportunities and constraints of writing for the Web.<br /> As a writing course, it should appeal to students in the Humanities; however, because of the growing importance of Web texts in fields such as business and the social sciences and given the opportunity to compose/construct a variety of fictional and non-fictional "creative" and informative/persuasive Web texts, this course should be of value to students across the college.In this course, students will survey a wide variety of Web texts--webs, electronic journals and
                            books, learning to analyze these as to their efficacy in light of each text's rhetorical situation. As students learn to compose and construct such texts themselves, rhetorically based principles of audience awareness and persuasive appeal will be emphasized. Rather than focusing on writing HTML and java script codes, this course will build on the rhetorical principles taught in first-year writing courses, teaching students how to apply those principles to more sophisticated, multi-sensory, multi-media hyper textual writing.<br />The course will be taught primarily in a hands-on workshop environment-in a PC computer lab or laptop-equipped classroom. Although no prior Web writing experience is required, some experience with Web navigation and computer word processing will be helpful. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their participation/attendance in the course's workshop environment, written web analyses, and constructed web texts.<br />  Select <strong>one</strong> of the following prerequisites:<br/> <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/engl/" target="blank">ENGL 15</a>  <br/> <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?P=ENGL%2030H" target="blank">ENGL 30H</a>  <br/> <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/search/?P=CAS%20137H" target="blank">CAS 137H</a><br/>*Course offered in Sp. semesters</span></div>

GEOG 160 Mapping Our Changing World (3) (GS)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Mapping involves producing and using geographic data. Geographic data specifies the locations and characteristics of people, the objects people create, and the various phenomena of the natural environment with which people interact. Geographic data is produced by several methods, including land surveying, aerial photography and photo grammetry, satellite remote sensing and positioning systems, and social surveys such as those conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Geographic information systems (GIS) and related technologies are used to turn data into maps, tables, and other kinds of information people need to make informed
                                decisions.<br /> In a rapidly changing world, detailed, up-to-date geographic data is indispensable for governance, for commerce, and for research intended to improve our understanding of social and environmental systems. GEOG 160 helps students begin to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that constitute geographic information literacy - the ability to 'recognize when information is needed and ... to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information' (ALA 1989). Geographic information science (GIScience) is are search enterprise concerned with the design, development, and use of geographic information technologies to help institutions and individuals not only respond to, but ideally to predict, environmental and social change.<br /> GEOG 160 is an introduction to GI Science that provides students with the technical and contextual knowledge they need to become knowledgeable consumers of geographic data and information produced by
                            government agencies, industry, and popular media. The course is intended to be of value not only to future specialists in the geographic information enterprise, but also to every student who is concerned with social and environmental research and policy-making. Like other information technologies, GIS is evolving rapidly. People who work with GIS understand that learning is a way of life, not just a prelude to a career. With this in mind, GEOG 160 aims not only to help students learn about geography and GIS, but also to develop the disposition to become effective lifelong learners.<br />*Course counts toward the <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/behrend/data-visualization-minor/">data visualization minor.</a> <br/> *Course offered during Fa. and Sp. semesters</span></div>

GEOG 161GEOG 161 Applied Geographic Information Systems (1) GEOG 161 is a one-credit two-hour laboratory course to be taken concurrently with GEOG 160, Mapping Our Changing World. GEOG 160 and GEOG 161 will be offered concurrently as a required course pair for the proposed Environmental Studies Option within the B.S. Science major (SCNBD) at Behrend College. The courses can also be choices in the 'Supporting Courses and Related Areas' list for the B.S. Science major's General, General Pre-certification, and Earth and Space Science Pre-certification options. The purpose of the course is to familiarize students with GIS and provide them with the ability to use GIS software commonly used by industry, academia, and government agencies.
                            GEOG 161 will provide students with training and experience in computer-based practical applications of concepts and theory learned in GEOG 160. They will analyze and solve 'real-world' problems using hands-on, problem-solving, and inquiry-based approaches to learning. Students will work individually and in small teams in a GIS software-equipped computer laboratory. Students will be evaluated based on the quality of laboratory reports/assignments and on a larger research project with a presentation conducted during the final five weeks of the semester. GEOG161 will be offered at least once per year.<br />*Course counts toward the <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/behrend/data-visualization-minor/">data visualization minor.</a><br/>*Course offered during Fa. and Sp. semesters</span></div>
