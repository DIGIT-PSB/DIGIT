                    <p>I grew up while the web was being born, and I've been adventuring in digital humanities for the past decade. Text and web tech is my medium in DIGIT! I teach classes that take up text like it's a textile, and weave it into structures on digital looms to build a web and work it into multimedia. I delight in tinkering with broken code, exploring stylesheets and JavaScript, and fixing broken markup and Python scripts. You'll hear me go on about "best practices" in trying to design projects just right to outlast moody tech trends, and I love nothing more than keeping projects alive and rescuing old digital projects from falling off the internets into link rot and ruin. I'm the Program Chair of DIGIT which means I have to make sense of our class schedules from semester to semester and do a ton of work making sure things run smooth for us! <br/><br/> The picture is me in my office—where I meet with lots of DIGIT students and teams on projects, which is my favorite thing to do in DIGIT!

                <p>Dr. Elliott is our data visualization professor. She loves all things data.
                    She loves it so much that she teaches about data in our psychology program
                    and in our functional data analytics program too! Dr. Elliott discovered a
                    love of data in graduate school at New Mexico State University in Las
                    Cruces, New Mexico, USA. There, she earned a PhD in experimental
                    psychology/engineering psychology. Dr. Elliott also does research in human
                    factors, human computer interaction, and the modeling of human behavior.
                    When Dr. Elliott isn’t at work, she enjoys fixing up her old house, playing
                    with her dog- Kitty Cupcake Mittens, and knitting.</p>

                    <p>I am a digital artist and educator whose work employs accessible means and equipment to create digital animation and photography. After graduating from Columbia University with an M.F.A, my experimentalist techniques "are against the grain of current computer-generated animation spectacles," as noted by art critic Ken Johnson of the New York Times. My work exhibited at the Hammer Museum, Whitney Museum, MoMA, Rotterdam Film Festival, and PBS Art:21 created several short documentaries on my life and work. I have taught for S.U.N.Y. Purchase and New York University for eight years before teaching at Penn State throughout these commercial, artistic accomplishments.</p>
