# Note about the DIGIT Showcase

If you're reading this, it's possible you're planning on creating an updated DIGIT program showcase
including new projects/artworks. This note is being written at the end of Summer 2024, and its purpose
is to guide your path to create the best showcase possible while also maintaing the standards of the DIGIT Program

- **Get your sources**
  - First up, you need to get your sources! Keep your eyes out for the DIGIT Works presentation each semester, that's a live presentation we do at the end of every semester that shows off everyone's work, including people outside of the DIGIT program but in adjacent classes or such. The Patricia Yahn Art Show is another place that you might see some cool projects.
  - Learn more about the DIGIT Works presentation here: [https://newtfire.org/courses/2024-04-DIGITShowcase.html](https://newtfire.org/courses/2024-04-DIGITShowcase.html)
  - **Get permission from the creators!** This is important, and you might think it's a pain to track down a bunch of college students, especially if you're working over the summer like I am, but you'll be surprised! DIGIT students are a judicious bunch, and I recieved prompt responses from everyone whose school emails I messaged! If your scrounging around on students' personal repos, you might find some alternative methods of contact.
- **Recording new project footage**
  - When I recorded footage for the showcase, I recorded EVERYTHING about each project, *much, MUCH* more
   footage than I needed. It made recording simple and clean, but it made sharing the footage I used to edit impossible since I ended up with really big files. As a result, if you want to include some classic projects in your new showcase vid, you'll either have to scrape the edited clip from my showcase, or else record more footage myself. **Here's how you should do it instead:**
  - Record/edit down very short clips, ideally 20-30 seconds long, and I'd recommend exporting your videos at the lowest resoultion possible that you can get away with. Our goal is to have all the projects represented in sub-25 megabyte video files, that can be uploaded to the DIGIT site's git repo. It'd be difficult to get an interesting variety of footage into that short of a time, but it's possible, and worth the effort!
- **Exporting your video correctly**
  - Once you've actually edited your showcase video, it's time to export it. Keep in mind that you want your video to load fast on the website (and its background). I'd follow this tutorial to ensure competent exports: [https://artlist.io/blog/how-to-compress-a-video/](https://artlist.io/blog/how-to-compress-a-video/)
  - The most important details are choosing H.265 as your codec, and adjusting the bitrate according to your resolution.
  - Keep in mind that you may want multiple versions. For instance, the 2024 version was edited alongside music, with a couple intentional fadeouts/ins that coinside with the song. For the site's backgorund, those edits wouldn't make sense, so I made another version without the music or those edits, with a slightly lower resolution. Remember: The background video is the first thing that people'll see on the website, it **NEEDS** to load in ASAP.
- **Mind the files!**
  - At the time of writing, we're working with Git LFS to store our videos online. Any change made to the video once it's pushed up will reupload the entire thing, so if you edit the video 1 single byte worth, you'll have to reupload the entire video, wasting time and space for LFS's limit. To that end, don't push your video to your repo until you have a completed version! 
  - You should have several iterations before you even think about pushing that large video! Upload unlisted to YouTube and share the video around, get critiques and advice, and most importantly, have fun! :)
