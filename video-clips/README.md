# Guidelines

We created this directory in May 2024 for the DIGIT Web Ops team to store video clips.

Remember you don't want to be trying to push any files larger than 100 MB. These are meant to be for short screen captures only suitable for web publishing.

The goal here will likely be to create short montages to demonstrate the range/variety of things we do in DIGIT.
